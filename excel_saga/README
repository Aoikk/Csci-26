This is a job interview question at Microsoft.

In Excel column names are named from A to Z, and then after that they become
AA, AB, AC, AD, ..., AZ, then BA, BB, BC, etc.

In this assignment you must convert a column number to an Excel column label,
and vice versa. A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, D is 4, etc. AA is 27, AB is 28, etc.

So if they convert 4 to Excel column label you output "D"

If they convert BA to integer, you output 53.
